# VLSI-AI-Copilot

🚀 *Personal VLSI Startup Project*

This is my experimental solo project — a vision to build an intelligent **chatbot assistant** tailored for **EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools** such as Synopsys ICC2, Design Compiler, and Cadence tools. I call it the **VLSI-AI-Copilot** — an AI-driven helper that understands your workflow and assists with tool commands, flow debugging, and documentation, just like a real engineer's assistant.

### 🎯 Goal  
To simplify and accelerate the VLSI design process through conversational AI support, especially for **beginners, students, and professionals** working in synthesis, physical design, or FPGA domains.

---

### 🛠️ Tech Areas Involved
- Digital and Analog VLSI  
- FPGA and Verilog  
- EDA Tool Flow (ICC2, DC, Genus, Virtuoso, etc.)  
- AI/ML (for future integration)  
- Custom scripting and automation  

---

### ❓ Why  
From personal experience, finding the **right command in CLI** or specific **features in GUI tools** often takes extra time. This project aims to **simplify flows** and reduce the learning curve.

---

### 👥 For Whom  
- Students learning VLSI and EDA tools  
- VLSI engineers in industry  
- Academic researchers  
- Anyone working with complex EDA environments  

---

### 🔭 Future Vision  
- **Prototype (current):** A chatbot that helps search commands and explains GUI features.  
- **Next phase:** Expands into a conversational assistant that:  
  - Explains VLSI concepts and theory  
  - Generates complete command scripts  
  - Guides through design flows step-by-step  
  - Assists in debugging tool errors
