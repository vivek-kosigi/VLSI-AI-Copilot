# VLSI-AI-Copilot

🚀 *Personal VLSI Startup Project*

This is my experimental solo project — a vision to build an intelligent **chatbot assistant** tailored for **EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools** like Synopsys ICC2, Design Compiler, and Cadence tools. I call it the **VLSI-AI-Copilot** — an AI-driven helper that understands your workflow and assists with tool commands, flow debugging, and documentation, just like a real engineer's assistant.

🎯 **Goal:**  
To simplify and accelerate the VLSI design process through conversational AI support, especially for beginners, students, and professionals working in synthesis, physical design, or FPGA domains.

🛠️ **Tech Areas Involved:**
- Digital and Analog VLSI
- FPGA and Verilog
- EDA Tool Flow (ICC2, DC, Genus, Virtuoso, etc.)
- AI/ML (for future integration)
- Custom scripting for automation

🔒 Currently in early private development. Stay tuned.
